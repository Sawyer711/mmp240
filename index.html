    <p>I'm a full time student here at BMCC and my major is Mutimedia Programming and Design. I chose
    major because I majored in Graphic Design back in highschool so I already had experience working
    with Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. I enjoy listening to music, drawing, reading and
    crocheting. I have 5 pets: 2 cats, a dog, a turtle and a beta fish.</p>
