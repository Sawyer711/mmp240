    <h1>LINZER COOKIES – CZECH LINECKÉ CUKROVI</h1>
    <p>These are small festive cookies made of shortbread pastry filled with
        fruit jam. They are classically shaped like hearts, flowers, or stars.
        Czechs bake Linzer cookies a few days before Christmas so that the cookies
        have time to soften.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and ½ cups all-purpose flour (200 g)</li>
        <li>1 and ¼ stick butter (140 g) unsalted</li>
        <li>½ cup powdered sugar (70 g)</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest freshly ground</li>
        <li>½ cup jam (150 g) e. g., raspberry or red curran</li>
        <li>⅓ cup powdered sugar (90 g) for dusting the top part of cookies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the flour in a bowl, add the cold chopped butter, sugar, egg yolk,
            and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Using your hands, work into a smooth dough. Stop kneading once the dough is soft;
            otherwise, the cookies will be too stiff. Wrap the dough in cling film, and put
            it in the fridge to rest for about two hours</li>
        <li>Take the dough out of the fridge and divide it in half. Put one half back in
            the refrigerator and leave the other on the kitchen counter for about 10
            minutes to soften. The dough should be stiff, not soft, but it should be able
            to be rolled out. Knead the dough briefly with your hands, making sure it is
            evenly smooth.</li>
        <li>On a floured work surface, roll out the dough to the thickness of a straw
            (about ⅛" or 3 mm) and cut out the shapes. I used a cookie cutter in the
            shape of a circle about 2 inches (5 cm) in size. If the top part has a hole
            in the middle, prepare an equal number of upper and lower cookie parts.</li>
        <li>After you have processed the first half of the dough, take the second half
            out of the fridge and proceed to make the cookies in the same manner.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cut-out Linzer tart shapes to a baking sheet lined with parchment
            paper using a flat knife.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies in a preheated oven at 350 °F (177 °C) for 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dust the slightly cooled tops of the cookies with icing sugar. Carefully spread
            the bottom cookie part with jam and cover it with the sugar-dusted top piece.</li>
    <li>Enjoy :)!!</li>
